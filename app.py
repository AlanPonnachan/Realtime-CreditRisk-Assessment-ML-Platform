This application simulates a real-world scenario where a bank uses a machine learning model
to assess the credit risk of new loan applications in real-time.

**Behind the Scenes:**
*   A sophisticated model (represented here by a Scikit-learn Logistic Regression pipeline) was **originally trained offline on a large historical dataset (potentially millions of loans) using distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark** to handle the scale.
*   This offline process involves complex feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
*   The pipeline saved from that process includes both data preprocessing steps and the trained model.
*   This app loads the *equivalent* pre-trained pipeline to score incoming applications instantly.

**Enter the details of a new loan application below to get a real-time risk assessment.**

In a production environment, the model's performance and the incoming data would be continuously monitored:

*   **Data Drift:** Are the characteristics of new applicants (e.g., average credit score, loan amounts) changing significantly compared to the training data? This could invalidate the model. *Techniques: Statistical tests (KS test), distribution comparisons.*
*   **Concept Drift (Performance):** Is the model's predictive accuracy degrading over time? Does the relationship between features and default change? *Requires joining predictions with actual loan outcomes (after months/years) and tracking metrics like AUC, Gini, F1-score.*
*   **Operational Health:** Is the scoring service fast and reliable? Are there errors?

Monitoring triggers alerts and potentially model retraining cycles to ensure the risk assessment remains accurate and reliable.
